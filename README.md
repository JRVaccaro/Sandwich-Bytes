# ü•™Sandwich Bytesü•™

## Description of the Project

Sandwich Bytes is an interactive Java console application that allows users to build and customize sandwich orders easily and intuitively. The application guides users through a clear menu-driven interface where they can:
Select sandwich sizes and bread types tailored to their preferences.

Users can:

- Pick a sandwich size and bread type

- Add meats, cheeses, sauces, and toppings

- Toast it or keep it fresh

- Add chips and drinks for a full meal

- Review their full order before checkout

- Save a receipt for later

- Even customize signature sandwiches like the Knuckle Sandwich or The Taternator

This project demonstrates core Java concepts such as object-oriented design, inheritance, and interfaces, while providing a real-world, user-friendly ordering experience. It‚Äôs a practical tool for practicing clean code principles and building a foundational understanding of interactive console applications.

## Interesting Code Snippet

In the Sandwich class, I use Java Streams to build a readable list of sandwich toppings. Instead of manually looping through each topping and appending commas, I use this stream code:

String toppingsJoining = toppings.stream()
    .map(Toppings::getType)
    .collect(Collectors.joining(", "));

sb.append(toppingsJoining);

## User Stories
